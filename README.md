# Introduction
This project was completed as Part of Year One of BSC Software Engineering at the University of Northampton.

It was part of the module CSY1018 - Web Development and was an assesment on completing an interactive webpage after being given some introductory code. This project  was weighted for 50% of the module grade. The other 50% is uploaded in a sepereate repositry under the same module name. 

This project is a 2D Game where the player moves to avoid bombs from the sky. 

The following features were implemented
- Life Counter
- Score Counter
- Player Controls
- Bombs are generated at random speeds
- Bombs are located in random places on the screen
- Bombs explode in random places on the grass
- Bombs can collide and hurt the player
- Bombs that touch the floor have a blast radius that can collide and hurt the player
- Simple Start Screen
- Simple Game Over Screen
- Leaderboard Started (Not completed)

# Brief (Simplified)
THe start of the game is provided with existing functionality for:
- Walking the character around using the arrow keys
- Preventing the player walking above the horizon
  
The aim of the game is that the player should dodge falling bombs. You should
randomly create bombs at the top of the sky that fall down towards the player. When the bomb
hits the ground it should explode.
Two CSS classes are provided for you for bombs:
- bomb (display a bomb)
- explosion (larger area, explosion)
When the bomb explodes, if the bomb touches the player they should lose a life (top right of the
screen). When the player has lost all three lives the game should say “Game over” with an option
to restart.

Then the brief continues with a list of the features needed for each grade boundary.
